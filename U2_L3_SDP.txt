2. The way that I plan for the user to be able to interact with the tic tac toe board is by having them select the row they want to place their token in, and then select between left, middle, and right for their placement.

3. check_win should be called within is_winner as it'll determine if a user wins by an if statement, which its condition will be if the player or the computer has won the game.

4. The slot selection will be its own function, taking in either the player or computers token, and give a set of inputs to the player to add their token to the slot.
